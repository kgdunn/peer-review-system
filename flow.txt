Send grades back:

https://community.brightspace.com/devcop/blog/so_you_want_to_extend_your_lms__part_1_lti_primer

To send back grades once a student has completed an assessment in a learning tool, the tool sends an HTTP POST back to the LMS via the URL specified in the [lis_outcome_service_url] field, the payload being a block of XML that contains the grade details.
